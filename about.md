Born in 1970, i live since then in a small village in bavaria. I am a husband and a proud father of two daughters.

A long time ago i made my degree in architecture, soon realizing being more interested in computers. 

> curiosity drives everything i do and try

I use Linux since around 2000 and tinker with nagios since 2005. In the meantime i became some kind of expert in system monitoring, but i have a strong interest in many aspects of modern computing - ranging from web development to systems management.
